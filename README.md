## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a Security Engineer with a strong foundation in enterprise networking and cloud security, focused on designing secure, resilient, and compliant architectures across AWS and Azure.

My experience spans identity and access management, network segmentation, hybrid cloud environments, and security monitoring. I specialize in applying Zero Trust principles, least-privilege access, and governance-driven design to protect critical systems.

I am actively advancing toward Cloud Security Architect roles through hands-on projects and architect-level certifications.
